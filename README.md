# UCM-SoE-Fall-2025-CAD-Hackathon
This is the main repository for the inaugural CAD Hackathon Event, hosted by the Vanguard Engineering Society at the University of California, Merced. 

# Event Overview
This 2-day event is structured to be an intensive, hands-on opportunity to sharpen your computer-aided design (CAD) skills in a competitive, real-world setting. Teams will create a small-scope design to realize using SolidWorks, with submissions graded based on (1) technical depth, (2) scope of implementation, and (3) efficiency and clarity of both CAD and assisting documentation. A number of seed templates are provided that give ideas for how the rubric can be instantiated with a tangible project, but teams are encouraged come up with their own ideas. Your project files will be hosted and managed entirely through this GitHub repository.

New Team Submissions will open November 20th, and all submissions/updates will close on November 27th. Teams have 30 hours after they upload the first team roster to make progress on their submission, and updates after that 30 hour window will not be considered for grading. The in-person event will take place from 9am-6pm on November 22nd and 23rd in SSM 102. There will be a number of in-person workshops at the in-person event, followed by a walkthrough of each of the submissions at the end of the second day. Also, there will be free food! Other than that, teams can participate in-person, virtual, or hybrid. Each qualified team will receive a 3D printed model of their design!

# Structure and Goals
The competition is split into two segments, centered around the complexity of the SolidWorks feature that it subtends. Qualified submissions must satisfy the minimum requirements for each of the **Basic Features** in addition to one of the **Intermediate Features**. The features are stratified into areas that roughly correspond with the SolidWorks certification exams, with Basic Features <-> SolidWorks Associate and Intermediate Features <-> SolidWorks Professional. Overviews of each of the basic and intermediate features are given below, but detailed descriptions are shown in the Rubric.

# Deliverables and Submitting your Work
Each team's submission must follow the a specific format for ease of collaboration and judging. Here is a guide on how to set up your team and the your submission format:
## Creating Your Team
Before your timer starts, you must create the branch that your team will make contributions to. 
### Setting up Github Desktop
For those uninitiated with Github, here's a quick rundown. Create an account with your school email and download Github Desktop on your machine (this works on the lab computers). Copy the Github's web address, then open Github Desktop and clone the repository using said link. Ask the event organizer (aglasgo@ucmerced.edu if virtual) to be added as a collaborator to the repository. You should get an email or notification in the github web client for the invite; accept it, and now you can contribute!
### Starting Things Up
Once you have the repository on your machine locally, copy the "Team Submission Template" subfolder in the "Submissions" folder. Change the folder name to your team's name, then change the contents of "roster.txt" to your team members. In GitHub Desktop, click current branch and **click "New Branch"**, giving it the your team's name. Then click publish branch.
### Changing Your Team Roster
There's no minimum or maximum to your team size, and the more the merrier! Removing someone from your roster is simple, just adjust the roster file. The event organizer will reach out to everybody who made contributions to your branch, so make sure that every participant pushed changes at least once! To add a member, contact the event organizer to add them to the repository. It is not recommended to send files through USB or email, but we can't stop you! It's just a hassle...
## Uploading Documents and Version Control
Again, always make sure you are on the appropriate branch when working with Github Desktop. You can download the most recent files by clicking "Fetch origin". When you have changed or added files, they will appear in the changes section on the left. You can "save" your changes by clicking commit in the bottom left. Once changes are committed, they will not appear to your teammates! For that, you have to upload your changes by clicking "Push Origin" at the top. If you get a message saying that there are merge conflicts, Bast save you... To avoid this, make sure that two people aren't making changes to the same part at the same time. 
## Deliverables
There are two parts of your final deliverable, the SolidWorks files and the design report. 
### SolidWorks Files
All SolidWorks files will live in their respective folder. Most submissions will have a single assembly file that depends on consituent part files. While there is no pre-defined naming convention, it is recommended that parts, subassemblies, drawings, etc. are named sensibly for ease of judging. Furthermore, any parts that are not designed from scratch will not be considered in the evaluation. You can still use parts/assemblies sourced externally (such as to contribute to a larger project with your submission), just identify which parts you acually designed during the competition. 
### Design Report
The presentation should be mixed text and visual media, and it should go over the scope of what you made and how you used SolidWorks features in a clever or efficient manner. A compelling presentation is a singificant factor in the evaluation of the submission, as a great design is worthless without good documentation. There is no minimum or maximum size of a report, so you should go into as much detail as is necessary to explain your design methodology and choices. Parts, features, and analyses that are not called out in the design report will be significantly penalized during evaluation. 
### Timeline
Each team will have 30 hours following the creation of their team's branch to make contributions. Does this mean that you can start working before you add team members? Not really, as any parts or segments of the design report that are added in bulk will be considered external parts (not designed from scratch during the event). The event organizer may notify teams that are near to the submission deadline, depending on how many teams there are (hehe). After that 30 hours, evaluation will proceed and should finish by Thanksgiving. Qualified Participants will receive their prints beginning December 1st.
