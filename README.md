# UCM-SoE-Fall-2025-CAD-Hackathon
This is the main repository for the inaugural CAD Hackathon Event, hosted by the Vanguard Engineering Society at the University of California, Merced. 

# Event Overview
This 2-day event is structured to be an intensive, hands-on opportunity to sharpen your computer-aided design (CAD) skills in a competitive, real-world setting. Teams will create a small-scope design to realize using SolidWorks, with submissions graded based on (1) technical depth, (2) scope of implementation, and (3) efficiency and clarity of both CAD and assisting documentation. A number of seed templates are provided that give ideas for how the rubric can be instantiated with a tangible project, but teams are encouraged come up with their own ideas. Your project files will be hosted and managed entirely through this GitHub repository.

New Team Submissions will open November 20th, and all submissions/updates will close on November 27th. Teams have 30 hours after they upload the first team roster to make progress on their submission, and updates after that 30 hour window will not be considered for grading. The in-person event will take place from 9am-6pm on November 22nd and 23rd in SSM 102. There will be a number of in-person workshops at the in-person event, followed by a walkthrough of each of the submissions at the end of the second day. Also, there will be free food! Other than that, teams can participate in-person, virtual, or hybrid. Each qualified team will receive a 3D printed model of their design!
